                    <p class="description">A practice which most of the newer generations lack is patience and reading. I read for 20 minutes on a daily basis because reading allows for improved neural networks, memory, and increased understanding of various concepts. I have
                        read 20 books over the past year including self-help books, fantasy novels, classic books, and math/quantum computing textbooks.</p>

                    <p class="description">Humans are built as a species that relies on society and groups. I believe that by networking and making truly meaningful connections with people around us can be very empowering. I speak to people not to gain something from them,
                        but to genuinely hear their thoughts and convey my thoughts as well. I have been using LinkedIn to connect with industry professionals, using social media to stay connected to hundreds of friends, and been a part of my neighbourhood
                        by developing deep bonds with everyone around me.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p class="description">A huge part of my focus in life has been habits and time management. After reading Atomic Habits and 7 Habits of Effective People, I realized that I needed to change my lifestyle if I wanted to become who I wish to be. I have been
                        developing several habits such as daily workouts, scheduling my time, reading, saying my prayers, brushing twice a day, learning something new everyday, and waking up early. I keep count of everyday that I have completed these
                        habits and by using "streaks", I motivate myself to continue with this self-improvement habits.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h3 class="name">Food + Nutrition</h3>
                    <p class="description">I have had uncontrolled overeating habits and a sweet tooth for most of my life. This has led me to an unhealthy lifestyle and body. I realized this in grade 11 and began to try to improve. After reading Atomic Habits and reflecting,
                        I realized the subconscious motive was my urge to eat until I felt stuffed. I started using little tricks like eating from smaller plates and chewing for longer times. After a while, these tricks changed my subconscious to think
                        I was stuffed. It took a few years to achieve a healthy weight, but I am proud of and love who I am now.<br><br><br><br></p>

                    <h3 class="name">Sports + Fitness</h3>
                    <p class="description">Being overweight and unfit has been an issue for the past 10 years of my life. I have been bullied and lost my self-esteem because of it. In the past few years, I realized that I needed to be healthier<br>for a longer life. It was
                        difficult to achieve due to constantly changing environments and uncontrolled overeating habits. One lesson I learned was consistency is key for fitness. My ever-changing environment would constantly break my momentum in workouts.
                        I would lose the motivation to get back on the right track. Recently,<br>I overcame this challenge by developing workouts which I could do in 15 minutes, no matter where I was.&nbsp; By creating an adaptable system which was easy
                        to do every day, I built up my momentum again and have been working out daily for over 100 days. <br><br><br><br></p>
